### BUGS AND ERRORS

<br>
When creating the run_survey function I encountered an error "Index Error: List index out of range" On closer expection I realised I had failed to seperate each question item with a comma, so the indexing was invalid. Once I added commas, the function ran as expected and generated feedback for the user.
